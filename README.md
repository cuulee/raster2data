# raster2data
This repository provides some introductory guidance for working with spatial image files, like rasters, and converting these to dataframes in order to perform statistical analyses on them. 
Some of this material is very much for beginners. When I was a beginner this type of document would have helped me, so I have pulled together some of what I have learned from trial and error, googling, asking other researchers and looking at stack overflow.
I now actually use most of these steps in my current research workflow and the code can be adapted for other images and problems.
I include an example image file, .Rmd file with code, a pdf and html file.
If you want to get in touch with me about this, I'm @thejholloway on twitter.
